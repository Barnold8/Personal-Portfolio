# Welcome to my programming portfolio

## Introduction

This portfolio will showcase my projects I have done throughout my time at The University Of Nottingham. Some modules will be left out due to them being mostly if not ***all*** theoretical. I will NOT be using the module names and module code numbers for this repo. I am doing this to stop any new students finding answers and/or solutions to problems in content that may still be used within the university. If you are one of these students, turn back now, you ***WILL*** be caught for plaigarism. 

## [University](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/)

## First year


### [PHP and SQL Website Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project involved creating a dynamic website using PHP to interface with an SQL database. The website I crafted for this module demonstrates the functionality of a mock movie database, showcasing the ability to store and retrieve movie information. To enhance security and prevent SQL injection attacks, JavaScript is used to sanitize inputs on the frontend. For a demonstration of the website, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ4swjO1exw).

### [ARM assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project involved writing programs in ARM assembly that ran using the [Komodo](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/resources/software/komodo/manual.html) emulator. This included mini projects like FizzBuzz to things like the printf function from [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)). These programs were written in ARM that ran in the Komodo emulator (it's not very good).


### [Programming in HDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project took me down the [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) route of learning HDL code to write everything from [adders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)) to an [ALU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20an%20arithmetic%20logic,operates%20on%20floating%20point%20numbers.)

### [C programming basics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project involved writing C code. In university this was one of the first modules we undertook. It was more of a "this is how to program for beginners" than it was anything else. However later down the line we did learn more advanced concepts and of course, because it is C, it included manually managing memory. 

### [Low level Server programming in C with djikstras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project took everything we knew from C and algorithms and took me through the process of making a lightweight server in C that uses djikstras algorithm to find the shortest path for server communications. It was all a theoretical environment, we didn't actually connect to any server over a network, it was just making a server and client program that ran on the same machine but we made it in C. 

### [Haskell basics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project taught me the fundamentals of functional programming using haskell. Each file in the repository is from a different coursework I had to do. While I don't remember the exact details of what I had to do in these courseworks, this does showcase my ability to learn new concepts and languages with ease. 

### [Learning Java basics and making reversi in Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project taught me about the fundamentals of Java and OOP programming in general. At the end of this module I had to make reversi in Java using the [Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/) GUI framework. 

## Second Year

### [C++ game using SDL2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)


### [Snake game using JavaFX and making it maintainable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)


### [Capital one smart receipt analyser app (group work)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

### [Operating system process scheduler using POSIX threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)


## Third Year

### [Implementing AES in Galois counter mode in Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

### [Visualising information via the observable javascript framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)


### [OpenGL programming in C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

### [Making an AI chatbot in Python using only NLTK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

### [Creating phone apps in android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

## Own time


## [PadPointMouse](https://github.com/Barnold8/PadPointMouse)

## [Pic2SpreadSheet](https://github.com/Barnold8/Pic2SpreadSheet)

## [TwitX](https://github.com/Barnold8/TwitX)


### Note:
This is now deprecated/doesnt work. Twitter/X constantly updates their site to stop things like TwitX from fixing their site. I ran out of free time due to University so I lagged behind. However a great repo called [control panel for twitter](https://github.com/insin/control-panel-for-twitter/) exists which does the same and even MORE than what TwitX does, so you should check that out. 

## [YTS](https://github.com/Barnold8/YTS)


## [Garys Shop](https://github.com/Barnold8/Garys-Shop)


### Note:
Valve has finally added a feature to collections to add all subscribed items to a collection, yay! This is an alternative to steams system, which seems to do the exact same as Garys shop. This works in the browser as a chrome extension. 

## [Steam Game Comparitor](https://github.com/Barnold8/SteamGameComparitor)


### Note:
Much like Garys Shop, Valve has added this feature to their steam software making this software depricated now.  


## [Job Finder API](https://github.com/Barnold8/JobFinderAPI)
