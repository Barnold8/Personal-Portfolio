# Welcome to my programming portfolio

## Introduction

This portfolio will showcase my projects I have done throughout my time at The University Of Nottingham. Some modules will be left out due to them being mostly if not ***all*** theoretical. I will NOT be using the module names and module code numbers for this repo. I am doing this to stop any new students finding answers and/or solutions to problems in content that may still be used within the university. If you are one of these students, turn back now, you ***WILL*** be caught for plaigarism. A lot of first year is a hazy memory to me, as I am writing this, it was ***two*** years ago. So a lot of content regarding first year is going to be incomplete and may even be somewhat innacurate since I may mistake a module for another or misrepresent some information as another. But rest assured, the subsequent years are within my full recollection. The first year was ungraded and is more here to show my progression throughout my degree. 

## [University](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/)

## First year


### [PHP and SQL Website Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project involved creating a dynamic website using PHP to interface with an SQL database. The website I crafted for this module demonstrates the functionality of a mock movie database, showcasing the ability to store and retrieve movie information. To enhance security and prevent SQL injection attacks, JavaScript is used to sanitize inputs on the frontend. For a demonstration of the website, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ4swjO1exw).

### [ARM assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project involved writing programs in ARM assembly that ran using the [Komodo](https://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/resources/software/komodo/manual.html) emulator. This included mini projects like FizzBuzz to things like the printf function from [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)). These programs were written in ARM that ran in the Komodo emulator (it's not very good).


### [Programming in HDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project took me down the [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) route of learning HDL code to write everything from [adders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adder_(electronics)) to an [ALU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20an%20arithmetic%20logic,operates%20on%20floating%20point%20numbers.)

### [C programming basics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project involved writing C code. In university this was one of the first modules we undertook. It was more of a "this is how to program for beginners" than it was anything else. However later down the line we did learn more advanced concepts and of course, because it is C, it included manually managing memory. 

### [Low level Server programming in C with djikstras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project took everything we knew from C and algorithms and took me through the process of making a lightweight server in C that uses djikstras algorithm to find the shortest path for server communications. It was all a theoretical environment, we didn't actually connect to any server over a network, it was just making a server and client program that ran on the same machine but we made it in C. 

### [Haskell basics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project taught me the fundamentals of functional programming using haskell. Each file in the repository is from a different coursework I had to do. While I don't remember the exact details of what I had to do in these courseworks, this does showcase my ability to learn new concepts and languages with ease. 

### [Learning Java basics and making reversi in Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project taught me about the fundamentals of Java and OOP programming in general. At the end of this module I had to make reversi in Java using the [Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/) GUI framework. 

## Second Year

### [C++ game using SDL2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project was making a game in SDL2 with a predefined library made by my professor. This library handled SDL2 on an abstract basis hiding a lot of the raw functionality of SDL2 in an attempt to make it easier (it made it harder). My game takes heavy inspiration from [The Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/). I had to code the collision detection and AI pathing. Collision was as simple as box to box collisions or circle to circle collisions. All of the rendering techniques had to be done by hand bar the basics boilerplate stuff in SDL2 that was abstracted by my professor. A video for this project can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMRoGM5__q8) (technical overview) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6BJbzGrij0) (game trailer).

### [Snake game using JavaFX and making it maintainable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This module focused on making software maintainable and fixing code that was objectively bad and/or incomplete. The ending result is a game of [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) using Java and the [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) GUI framework. The original GUI framework for this was [Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/) but I ported it over to [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/). To be transparent, the change between frameworks is because swing is deprecated and cannot be maintained any longer. Anything new could conflict with old libraries of swing and security risks are bound to appear making it silly to keep swing as the framework of choice. 

### [Capital one smart receipt analyser app (group work)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This module centered on group work and included a singular assignment sourced from Capital One. Our group consisted of seven members, although only four were consistently active throughout the majority of the project. The project involved developing a smart receipt analyzerâ€”a phone application that performs OCR on receipts, sends the extracted information to an API, and uses categorization techniques to accurately categorize items. It then performs statistical analysis on the receipts to help users better manage their budgets. The results of the statistical analysis were presented to users through [information visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_and_information_visualization) and interactive components.

We managed this project using sprints and conducted team meetings after every two sprints. Every other meeting included the same assigned Capital One employee each time to discuss progress and ask questions in regards to what is expected of the software. Each member had specific roles.

My specific contributions included:
- Creating a RESTful API in Python using Flask.
- Developing and maintaining an SQL database.
- Facilitating interactions between the AI and the database through API calls.
- Preserving app sessions via session tokens (establishing a many-to-one relationship).
- Managing user accounts.
- Handling communications between frontend and backend components via the API.
- Initially creating the Docker container and subsequently upgrading it to Docker Compose to support multiple containers.
- Co-maintaining the Docker configuration with a group member to ensure stability and utility. 

The project achieved a categorization success rate of 85%, utilizing techniques such as [fuzzy matching](), [NLP](), and [Bayes' theorem](). Essentially, we developed an AI that categorizes items with a high success rate, all running on a phone.

At the end of this project we both showcased our application to the University during an Open-Day and also to the members at Capital One in their building in Nottingham. Both parties were delighted with the amount of work achieved and the quality of said work!

### [Operating system process scheduler using POSIX threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This module provided an in-depth understanding of operating systems, covering topics such as paging memory, process management, queues, concurrency, disk I/O methodologies, forks, and PIDs. Our project involved simulating a process scheduler in C. The process scheduler was required to queue processes based on priority while simulating I/O operations. This added complexity because I/O operations typically take longer than regular CPU processes. To achieve this, we incorporated process tables, queues, and a disk scheduling algorithm. 

## Third Year

### [Implementing AES in Galois counter mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project focused on implementing [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) in [GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode). I was given a set of code tests (I think they were Junit?) to pass to ensure the correct implementation of AES in GCM.

### [Visualising information via the observable javascript framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project was to take a topic of my choosing and ask questions on said topic. My topic revolved around mental health in England. I ask questions like "How much do finances contribute to depression" and "What parts of England on average are more depressed?". I go over these questions gathering data from various sources, (everything is explained and referenced properly in the coursework), and I then clean the data if needed, ensure its fit for its use and then perform a data visualisation on it to answer the question. I go over how I clean, transform and fit the data for all instances that I use data, which is very often and I also reflect on the results that transpire from the visualisations. 

This project can be seen [here](https://observablehq.com/d/bd50049bcdde6885) but the git repo is there for the event that the link is no longer available. 

### [OpenGL programming in C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)


This module was 3 whole projects in [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) with [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) and [openGL](https://opengl.org/). The first project is [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/c) but thats abstracted away by my professor since it is not needed to be known to achieve the marks for the coursework.


#### **Project 1** 

Software render a triangle in [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/c) using rasterising techniques we learned during the module like [Barycentric coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinate_system) and [antialisasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aliasing) via [multi sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing). 

#### **Project 2**

Make an OBJ parser and load an OBJ into memory and render it using [openGL](https://opengl.org/). While this sounds simple on paper, it can be quite complex if you don't know [openGL](https://opengl.org/) and haven't ever made an OBJ parser. 

#### **Project 3**

This was to create a graphics scene of my choosing, it was that open ended which was brilliant. I decided to go for a somewhat PS2 style scene with a heavy influence on the Silent Hill games. This required that I do texturing, lighting, procedural generation, shadows to get the main marks. However there was an R&D section in which I chose to do the following:


- [Linear Fog](https://youtu.be/oQksg57qsRA?t=224)
- [Text rendering](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/Text-Rendering)
- Dynamic light arrays [arrays in GLSL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Data_Type_(GLSL)#Arrays)
- [Procedural terrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation) generation using a [noise map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise)
- [Skybox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skybox) using a [cubemap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_mapping) 
- [FPS cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate)
- [Dynamic shadows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mapping)
- Camera animation track with [Bezier curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve)


### [Making an AI chatbot in Python using only NLTK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This project was to make an AI chatbot in python using principles in natural language processing. My version of this coursework was a playlist manager via a chatbot interface. The chatbot handled things like small talk, trivia and of course, playlist management. The way I achieved this with no external libraries except for [NLTK]() was to use classifiers. In AI based systems, a classifier can be taught, or used outright to classify information using mathematical probability. In my AI chatbot, I used the [Naive Bayes Theorem]() to match specific actions, attributes and sentiments to predefined outputs. For example, sentences like "I would like to make a playlist", "make a playlist" and "want a playlist" would activate the playlist classification" because they hold the closest probability to being a match with the predefined outputs that relate to making a playlist. I also used [Sentiment Analysis]() to determine if the outcome of the AI met the users needs based on their response. This was also used to determine if the user wanted or didn't want to do something. For example, "I don't want to make a playlist" would match the playlist classification but it would not do anything because the sentiment is negative. 


### [Creating phone apps in android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404)

This module had two projects within it. 

- **Project 1**
    - An MP3 player
        - Picking songs
        - Loading songs

        - [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller#)
        - Appropriate permission management
- **Project 2**
    - Geotracking application
        - Track travelled paths when user specifies to do so
            - Choose type of path [Walking, running, cycling]
        - [DAO](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/accessing-data)
        - Exposing database so other apps can read information but not write
        - Set reminders that trigger in geofenced areas
        - [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller#)
        - Save data
        - Statistical analysis of exercises
        - Inspect geofences
        - Proper use of android life cycles
        - Communication between components using serialsiable data structures
        - Proper use of activities and intents (intents were used primarily to switch between activities and also send serialisable data)
        - [Background services](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services)
        - Google maps interfacing to allow for interactable geofencing placements and to visualise paths taken while recording activities
        - Appropriate permission management

## Own time


## [PadPointMouse](https://github.com/Barnold8/PadPointMouse)

## [Pic2SpreadSheet](https://github.com/Barnold8/Pic2SpreadSheet)

## [TwitX](https://github.com/Barnold8/TwitX)


### Note:
This is now deprecated/doesnt work. Twitter/X constantly updates their site to stop things like TwitX from fixing their site. I ran out of free time due to University so I lagged behind. However a great repo called [control panel for twitter](https://github.com/insin/control-panel-for-twitter/) exists which does the same and even MORE than what TwitX does, so you should check that out. 

## [YTS](https://github.com/Barnold8/YTS)


## [Garys Shop](https://github.com/Barnold8/Garys-Shop)


### Note:
Valve has finally added a feature to collections to add all subscribed items to a collection, yay! This is an alternative to steams system, which seems to do the exact same as Garys shop. This works in the browser as a chrome extension. 

## [Steam Game Comparitor](https://github.com/Barnold8/SteamGameComparitor)


### Note:
Much like Garys Shop, Valve has added this feature to their steam software making this software depricated now.
