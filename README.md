# Welcome to my programming portfolio

## Introduction

This portfolio will showcase my projects I have done throughout my time at The University Of Nottingham. Some modules will be left out due to them being mostly if not ***all*** theoretical. I will NOT be using the module names and module code numbers for this repo. I am doing this to stop any new students finding answers and/or solutions to problems in content that may still be used within the university. If you are one of these students, turn back now, you ***WILL*** be caught for plaigarism. 

## [University](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/)

Ones to show (self note):

## Own time

## [Pic2SpreadSheet](https://github.com/Barnold8/Pic2SpreadSheet)


## [TwitX](https://github.com/Barnold8/TwitX)


### Note:
This is now deprecated/doesnt work. Twitter/X constantly updates their site to stop things like TwitX from fixing their site. I ran out of free time due to University so I lagged behind. However a great repo called [control panel for twitter](https://github.com/insin/control-panel-for-twitter/) exists which does the same and even MORE than what TwitX does, so you should check that out. 

## [YTS](https://github.com/Barnold8/YTS)


## [Garys Shop](https://github.com/Barnold8/Garys-Shop)


### Note:
Valve has finally added a feature to collections to add all subscribed items to a collection, yay! This is an alternative to steams system, which seems to do the exact same as Garys shop. This works in the browser as a chrome extension. 

## [Steam Game Comparitor](https://github.com/Barnold8/SteamGameComparitor)


### Note:
Much like Garys Shop, Valve has added this feature to their steam software making this software depricated now.
